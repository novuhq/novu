            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋
            
            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Your PR title is: "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
            It should be something like: "feat(scope): Add fancy new feature"
            Where scope is one of: ${{ env.SCOPES }}

            Details:
            
            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
      - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
