# Plivo

You can use the [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/) provider to send SMS messages to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

## Getting Started

To use the Plivo provider in the SMS channel, the first step is to create a Plivo account and add the Account SID and Auth token to the Plivo integration on the Novu platform.

## Find the Account SID and Auth token

[Sign up](https://console.plivo.com/accounts/register/) or [Login](https://console.plivo.com/accounts/login/) to your Plivo account, and make a note of your Account SID and Auth token on the [Plivo console page](https://console.plivo.com/dashboard/).
