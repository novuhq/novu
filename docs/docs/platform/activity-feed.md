# Activity Feed

Novu provides a notification activity feed that monitors every outgoing message associated with its relevant metadata.
This can be used to monitor activity and discover potential issues with a specific provider or a channel type.

## Viewing a specific subscriber's activity

To use a subscriber's activity feed you can filter the feed by using the subscriberId or email. This will show only the relevant data for this particular subscriber.

You can hover over the status icon to get additional information, in case there was an error during delivery.

## Filter by template or channel

The activity feed allows you to filter messages based on the associated notification template or channel. This is helpful when you want to assess or debug a particular template and its behaviour.

## Future plans for this page

In the upcoming releases we will update this page with more information regarding the stack trace of a notification template across the different providers.

Follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) to get the latest updates on this.
