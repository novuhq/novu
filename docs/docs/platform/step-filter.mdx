# Step Filter

Workflow step filtering allows you to customize the flow of notifications in your
workflow by specifying criteria for which notifications should be delivered. You can use this
filter to ensure that only relevant notifications are sent to your subscribers,
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your communication.

## On Filter

- On payload: You can specify a list of keywords or values that the `payload` field must
  match in order for the notification to be delivered. This is useful if you only want to
  receive notifications that contain certain information.

- On subscriber: You can filter which subscriber should receive notifications based on subscriber
  information. This means that you can send notifications to specific individuals or groups
  rather than all subscribers. It checks on subscriber attributes. Read more about [subscriber attributes](./subscribers#subscriber-attributes).

- On webhook: You can use this feature to provide information about subscribers from specified
  webhook response and use that information to filter the notification flow. For example, if your webhook
  returns a field indicating whether a subscriber is currently online, you can use this field
  to send notifications only to online subscribers.

- On online right now: You can filter notifications on the basis of the current online status of the subscriber.
  For example, You can choose to send a notification if the subscriber is currently online or offline.

- On online in the last `X` time period: You can use this to filter notifications for a subscriber
  if the subscriber was online in the last `X` minutes/hours/days.

### Steps to set filter

1. Create a step in your workflow. This step will be the location where
   you will apply your filter.

2. Add a filter to the step. This will allow you to specify the criteria that must be
   met for the notification to be delivered.

   <div align="center">
     <picture>
       <source
         media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
         srcset="/img/platform/filter/dark-filter-section.png"
       />
       <img src="/img/platform/filter/light-filter-section.png" width="1280" alt="Logo" />
     </picture>
   </div>

3. If you want to add multiple filters, you will need to choose a logical condition
   between `AND` and `OR` (1). This will determine how the filters are applied to the notification.
   For example, if you choose `AND`, the notification will only be delivered if all of the
   filters are met. If you choose `OR`, the notification will be delivered if any of the
   filters are met.

4. Add a rule to the filter (2). This will specify the criteria that must be met for the
   notification to be delivered. You can use the `payload`, `subscriber`, or `webhook` field
   as the basis for your rule. For example, you might specify that the `payload` field must
   contain a certain keyword or that the `subscriber` must be in a specific group.

:::info
If only one rule is provided, `AND` and `OR` both conditions behaves in the same way.

</div>

## Filter rule

A filter rule is composed of the following elements:

- **On field** : This specifies which field the rule should be applied to, such as `Payload`, `Subscriber`, or `Webhook` response.

- **Key field** : This specifies the object key that the rule should be applied to. For example,
  if the `On` field is `Subscriber`, the `Key` field might be `name`, `email` etc.

- **Operator field** : This specifies the comparison operator to use when evaluating the rule.
  Options include **Equal**, **Not equal** , **Larger** , **Smaller** , **Larger or equal**, **Smaller or equal** , **Contains**, **Not contains** and **Is Defined**.

- **Value field** : This specifies the `value` to compare to the object
  key value using the selected `operator`.

**Example**: In this filter rule, the notification will only be delivered if the
webhook response includes a field called `isOnline` that is set to `true`.

## Filtering with Webhook

To filter notifications based on a webhook response, you will need to create a webhook
that accepts POST requests and returns a one-level object. The webhook should be set up
to receive object the following parameters:

- **subscriber** - This is an object containing information about the subscriber that
  the notification is being sent to.
- **payload** - This is an object containing the payload of the trigger that initiated
  the notification.
- **identifier** - workflow identifier is a unique identifier for the notification
  template being used.
- **providerId** - provider identifier is a unique identifier for the communication provider you used
  on this notification.
- **channel** - The channel identifier specifies the type of notification channel that was used to send
  the notification.

### Securing your webhooks

To secure your webhooks, Novu uses the `nv-hmac-256` header as a security measure. This header
contains an HMAC hash that is calculated based on your `API Key` and `Environment Id`, ensuring
that the request is coming from Novu. This helps in protection against unauthorized access and
tampering with your webhooks.

To verify the authenticity of the request, you can use the following code:

```javascript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', 'NOVU_API_KEY').update('ENVIRONMENT_ID').digest('hex');

if (hmacHash === hmac) {
  // The request is authentic
} else {
  // The request is not authentic
}
```

> **ENVIRONMENT_ID** can be accessed in the webhook subscriber parameter in the request body.
> **NOVU_API_KEY** can be found in the settings section of the Novu client.

The webhook should return a one-level object containing any information that you want to use
to filter the notification flow. For example, you might include a field called `isOnline` having value `true` or `false` that specifies whether the subscriber is currently online or not.

## Subscriber online filters

This allows you to apply a filter on workflow step based on the `subscriber's` online status. The filter can be applied to determine if the subscriber is currently online or if the subscriber was online in the **X** time-period.

**Example** :
To send an email notification to all subscribers who were active within the last 30 minutes, follow these steps:

- On the Workflow editor page, add an `Email` step after trigger in workflow.
- Click on this email step to edit its content template.
- Click on the `Add Filter` button from the upper right position.
- Use `And` condition.
- Select `Online in the last X time period` and choose `minutes` as the time period.
- Enter `30` in the input field.

<div align="center">
  <picture>
    <source
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
      srcset="/img/platform/filter/dark-is-online-filter.gif"
    />
    <img src="/img/platform/filter/light-is-online-filter.gif" alt="is-online-filter" />
  </picture>
</div>

By applying this filter, the notification will only be delivered to subscribers who have been active within the last 30 minutes, ensuring that the message is reaching engaged and active recipients.

### Online filter mechanism

Novu uses a websocket connection within the `notification-center` package to track the online status of subscribers. The `isOnline` and `lastOnlineAt` fields of the subscriber's entity are updated accordingly.

When a subscriber comes online, an active websocket connection is established with the server. Novu then updates the `isOnline` field of the subscriber's entity to `isOnline: true`. When the subscriber disconnects, Novu updates `isOnline: false` and `lastOnlineAt: current_timestamp`.

The online filter feature can be used to determine if a subscriber is online right now or if the subscriber was online within a specific time period.

- To determine if a subscriber is online right now, Novu checks the value of the `isOnline` field. If `isOnline` is `true`, the subscriber is online, otherwise when the `isOnline` is `false` the subscriber is considered offline.

- To determine if a subscriber was online within a specific time period, Novu compares both the `isOnline` and `lastOnlineAt` fields. If `isOnline` is `true`, the subscriber is still online and the filter is applied. If `isOnline` is `false`, the difference between the `current timestamp` and the `timestamp` value of `lastOnlineAt` is calculated. If this difference is within the specified time period, the subscriber was online within that time period and the filter is applied. Otherwise, the filter is not applied.

For example, to determine if a subscriber has been online in the last 5 minutes, Novu checks if the subscriber is currently online or if the `lastOnlineAt` timestamp value is less than or equal to 5 minutes ago. If either of these conditions are met, the filter is applied.

## Subscriber Seen / Read filters

This filter gives the flexibility of executing successive step notifications based on the status of previous step notification. It currently works for in-app and email step notifications.

**Typical Use Case**:

You have a set of customers to whom you need to send a 2-step email. However, they should only get the second email if they have read/seen the first email.

With the new seen/read filter, you can do the following in a notification workflow:

- Set the first email step.
- Set a delay.
- Set the second email step.
- Create a filter on the second email step that indicates if the previous step needs to be seen/read before it should be executed.

    />
  </picture>
</div>

:::note
For this filter to work with emails, the webhook url needs to be set up for the active `email` provider you're using on Novu. It's very essential for the filter to work. No extra set up is needed for `in-app` notifications.
:::

## Is Defined filter

Is Defined filter checks whether specified `key` exists or not. It is different from `Equal` and `Not equal` filter. `Equal` and `Not equal` filter checks whether key value is equal to specified value or not, but `Is Defined` filter just checks whether key is present or not.

  </picture>
</div>

:::note
This filter can be used with subscriber, payload and webhook. It can be applied on all channels.
