## **Introduction**

Everyone has a smartphone with lots of storage space and processing power. People install the applications that they need to perform their daily work activities based on their needs. Notifications, a feature that alerts users to new or pending information in an app, can be accessed directly from the home screen.

The average person has more than 40 apps installed on their phone. Eighteen of these, which represent less than 10% of the total number, account for 89% of the time spent by users on their phones—meaning that around half are rarely or never used. Now the question is whether people will regularly interact with all those applications or only use them when it's necessary to handle a specific task!

This is where notification intent comes into play:

## What are notifications?

Notifications are messages displayed on a mobile device outside an app's user interface. They provide reminders, communication from other people or timely information from apps—and can be tapped by users to open that app or take another action immediately.

Notification pop-ups are designed to provide users with clear notifications of activities that occur in an app.

That was the standard notification abstract; it is important to understand the concept before delving into the related topic.

Notifications are classified into two types:

1. **Push notifications**
2. **In-app notifications**

The topic of our conversation is **in-app notifications**. Let's look at what in-app notifications are, and how they can be used to engage users.

Simply put, these are notifications that are received or prompted within an app to direct the user's attention to a specific activity for interaction.

These notifications provide information or prompt action from the user. When used correctly, they can increase user satisfaction while having a positive impact on application growth. This notification is displayed when we open the app; it is more context-oriented and targets users based on their interests and interactions.

Unfortunately, we've noticed that many users tend to ignore or dismiss these completely—or worse yet (in terms of our business objectives), uninstall the app because they feel spammed by too many advertisements.

They are a new market trend that is growing steadily because they directly target users.

Type of in-app Notifications:

- **Transactional in-app notifications**: Interactive prompts that inform users about the application and assist them in understanding and using its various functionalities.
- **Non-transactional in-app notifications**: Non-interactive prompt that displays new updated features to users.

There are several types of in-app notifications:

- Full-page message (which appears on your screen in-app)
- Centre of the screen (small rectangular popup)
- Banner at the bottom (for unobtrusive communication.)
- Banner at the top (feels like push notification)

### Where are they used?

- For asking feedback
- Rating something
- To redirect somewhere
- Information about products, services, etc
- Rate and review of the product

## Why are in-app notifications beneficial to a product?

The in-app messages are highly interactive, and users react differently to them because of the graphical effects. This usually leads to sharing, using, or downloading the service/product.

These notifications provide numerous advantages to product teams, including:

- **Enhanced visibility**: In-app messages are delivered to all users based on demographics, timing, and other triggers. Although a user may disable push notifications, businesses can rely on in-app notifications to draw their audience's attention to valuable information.
- **Personalized messaging**: Product teams can tailor notifications to a user's specific preferences or behavior.
- **Improved user experience**: These messages provide a delightful user experience with proper segmentation and targeting.
- **Increased customer retention**: In-app notifications increase application usage and user retention while also increasing the user's lifetime value.

Here are a few advantages of in-app notifications:

- Increase [LTV](https://mixpanel.com/topics/mobile-app-analytics-metrics) (User Lifetime Value)
- Increase app usage
- Increase app retention
- They push forward freemium conversions
- They allow you to test and optimize flows

And here are common use cases:

- Personal recommendations.
- Gamification elements.
- An easy way to tell friends.
- Short tips.
- Adding friends.
- Getting the user’s consent to receive push notifications.
- Asking for feedback.
- Inform about new features.
- Gather NPS(Net Promoter Score) and discover advocates.
- A/B test marketing messages.
- Onboard new users.
- Suggest additional features.
- Cross-sell, upsell.
- Guide users through the optimal experience.
- Prompt users to update the app.
- Prompt users to enable push notifications.
- Product tours for onboarding new users.
- Task lists for setting up new users.
- Smart tips for highlighting new or popular features.
- Step-by-step guidance for reducing time-to-value.
- Product announcements for upgrades, new features, or special promotions.
- NPS or review call-to-actions.

For examples:

## How does in-app notification work?

They are the same as push notifications but they have no effect on user interaction or application experience, and users do not have to opt-out of apps to avoid them, so they have become interactive because users are already using apps with this type of pop-up diverting their attention. They are displayed in a small pop-up box on the app screen.

This type of message or popup is extremely important for marketers when promoting products or introducing new services; they can also be used to pique users' interest by providing short surveys.

To send effective in-app notifications, product teams must be able to do three things that not all apps have natively:

- Identify unique users within the app
- Selectively target, schedule, and notify users
- Analyze the effects of notifications


![Insta](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k6jch8rlirb407a2qlhu.png)

These can be configured to appear as full-screen or miniature pop-ups. Each can have the following components:


![Notification](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x40dwvwehrlvfyz81q7r.png)

**Text**: Written content that teaches, rewards, informs, or entertains the user. It's short and simple, so anyone can understand it. In general, it encourages users to act.

**Graphics**: Images, backgrounds, or color themes that are relevant to the overall application design.

**Links or deep links**: References to data that users can follow. Deep links take users directly to an application instead of a website.

For example,

- Many app providers now embed in-app reporting notifications about improper service operations, which can be used to improve the user experience even further. Users' opinions are valued as a result of this opportunity.
- They are used to signal the expiration of coupons, purchased services, and so on.

### Why shouldn't it be used?

- Don't force action from users unless it's important and critical.
- Unnecessarily alerts that don't require user interaction.
- Don't over-communicate.

## What are the best practices for in-app notifications?

They should be perceived as more helpful guides, not as obnoxious interruptions!

### Set clear goals

Be specific about your goal because you are about to annoy users. It must be improved. Sometimes the notification can irritate users, leading to the app's decline.

### Segment users

Divide the customers into groups based on their interests and send them personalized messages.

### Test, analyze, and optimize

Implement the design to interact with the user and optimize the notification in time constraints using the data collected.

### Coordinate in-app notifications with all your other marketing efforts

Coordination between teams is required, which means that the same notification should not be sent via email, SMS, or other means.

### Don’t over-communicate

Communicate only what is necessary and nothing more. Users are extremely sensitive to overly chatty apps and are easily irritated.

### Deliver value

Finally, communicate only when necessary. Ask whether every element in every in-app notification your team creates supports your primary goal.
